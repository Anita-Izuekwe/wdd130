        <p>Hello! My name is Izuekwe Anita and I am from Lagos, Nigeria.I am currrently a Physiology student at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos Idi araba and it is a real hassle to joggle med school and web programming but I want to be thee besst of myself possible so everything is worth a try. I enjoy going on dates and spending time with my loved ones. Currently, I am learning web development at an online school and I will graduate in 2 years and I wonder what life will be like for me. I plan to create my own website and sell crochet wears. I also love to cook and watch movies and series, a while ago I used to own a food business, the struggle is real if you ask me. I have always wanted to be independent, happy and financially stable. I did not grow up with a silver spoon, I have had to learn life the hard way, struggling at every step I take and honestly I am tired and I hope that my decision to kearn prograamming can help to make my life better and easier. I am so excited to go on this journey and become the best version of myself.</p>
